- ideally, implement TDD prior to writing code  
- some books do not have a publisher (ex: when using keyword "dog")
- need to address situations where there are fewer than 5 books to display 
- need to address invalid inputs for keyword (ex: if user enters random gibberish)

stretch goals:
- can consider creating separate classes to keep track of different users and their reading lists (not required for this assessment)
